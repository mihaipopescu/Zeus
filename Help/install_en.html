    <h2>Zeus installation</h2>
	The installation is made through the<b>"setup.exe"</b> program or <b>"Zeus Setup.msi"</b>. <br/>
	Follow the instructions which appear and Zeus will be installed in the system in a transparent way. <br/>
	The Zeus application consists in two libraries (zeus.dll and zipaes.dll) which are registered with Windows Explorer.<br/>
	<b>The system must be restarted so that the program can be successfully installed.</b><br/>
	Zeus appears in the Start menu and has only one reference to the help files. <br/>
	</p>
	<p> <h2>System requirements</h2>
	Zeus works on <b>Windows 2000/XP/Vista</b> but you should have administrator rights when you install it. 
	If the overlay icon doesn't appear restart the computer or just the "explorer.exe" (from "Task Manager").
